FEATURES:

Kerbal Object inspector is a plugin which allows mod developers to see exactly what's going on in the background of any game scene by listing every game object and their properties.

- Easy to use interface.
- Lists all game objects, mesh or not.
- Organizes game objects based on the Unity hierarchy. Child objects are displayed indented under parent objects.
- Displays transform and other component information for any game object.
- Efficiently renders a wireframe on any game object with a mesh.
- Objects that are a parent of the selected object have dimmer wireframes.

CHANGELOG:
