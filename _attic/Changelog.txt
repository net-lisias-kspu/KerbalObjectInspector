1.2.0
	Thanks to @gotmachine for all of these changes:
		Hirearchy : reworked the general UI options
		Hierarchy : reworked mouse hover selection, now require holding ALT, added UI/object selection capacities
		Hierarchy : huge performance improvements (doesn't re-parse anymore the whole scene hierarchy every update)
		Hierarchy : ability to find/show disabled objects
		Hierarchy : ability to browse/search the whole resource database (prefabs, internal unity objects...), by object name or by component type (a bit laggy but does the job)
		Hierarchy : now show objects in the right order
		Hierarchy : removed sorting feature and ability to dump the hierarchy to a text file (could be re-added if necessary but that's a bit useless and I'm lazy)
		The wireframe viewer is now only added to the selected object and not whole hierarchy (was causing severe perf issue)
		Added wireframe visualization for RectTransforms
		Fixed toolbar button not showing with stock toolbar (was working only with blizzy)
		Inspector : now only show details for only 1 component at a time (fix lag with large/many component), better usability.
		Inspector : now show the gameobject fields/properties (and not only the components)
		Inspector : allow to enable/disable gameobjects
		Inspector : various UI tweaks alignment, colors, handling of long values, fix height flickering...
		Inspector : option to show non public / static members
		Added a "value editor", allow setting fields/properties for primitive types and some common Unity/KSP primitives (Color, Vector, Quaternion, etc...)
